      <h3>What is an FMEA?  <small class="text-secondary text-sm" style="font-size:18px">October 15, 2020</small></h3>
      <p>To quote from Wikipedia:</p>
      <p><em>"Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA; often written with "failure modes" in plural) is the process of reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis,[1] but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical failure rate models[2] are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database. It was one of the first highly structured, systematic techniques for failure analysis. It was developed by reliability engineers in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.</em></p>
      <p><em>A few different types of FMEA analyses exist, such as:</em></p>
      <p><em>
          <ul>
            <li>Functional</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Process"</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Product Launch  <small class="text-secondary text-sm" style="font-size:18px">October 14, 2020</small></h3>
      <p>FMEA.Lite started with the goal of simplifying the FMEA process, empowering designers and engineers to spend more time on capturing collective experience and less time on the mechanics of documentation.</p>
      <p>We wanted to provide a truly collaborative, real-time environment where all team members can contribute their ideas without judgement. Through collective assessment, a detailed FMEA can be generated at the click of a button, providing guidance to design teams on where to focus their attention to best meet the product design goals.</p>
