Type,Description,Rating,deadline,status,followup
function,Must be comfortable for the rider,,,,
failure_mode,Handlebar to seat spacing causes pain to the riders,,,,
cause,Insufficient seat adjustment distance (currently 10cm),2,,,
effect,"Customers unsatisfied, receive bad reviews leading to loss in sales",3,,,
cause,Lack of customer ergonomic data,3,,,
action,Please can you follow up on this by organising a focus group,,06/11/2020,completed,I have organised this for the 06-Oct-20
failure_mode,Insufficient dampening from road bumps,,,,
cause,No suspension installed on front fork,5,,,
cause,Tyres are too narrow (currently 25mm) and don't provide enough cushioning to rider,5,,,
action,Please can you organise a review of the tyre selection choice and report back on Monday,,01/11/2020,pending,
effect,Minor discomfort is felt by the rider when cycling on roads other than tarmac,1,,,
function,Must be able to sport weight of 160kg rider,,,,
failure_mode,Seat clamp cannot provide enough friction to maintain seat height,,,,
cause,Seat clamp component is new and untested,3,,,
effect,Rider continually has to re-adjust the seat post,2,,,
failure_mode,Frame fatigues over time eventually leading to a mechanical failure,,,,
effect,Bike requires new frame after >2 years of service,4,,,
effect,"Customers unsatisfied, receive bad reviews leading to loss in sales",3,,,
cause,New alloy selection is known to have embrittlement risks when subjected to cyclical loading,2,,,
action,Please can you speak to the material engineer and decide if we need to conduct some lab testing,,05/11/2020,in progress,I have organised a meeting for the 29/10/2020
function,Must be able to fold up in < 2 mins,,,,
failure_mode,Folding time exceeds 2 mins but is less than 4 mins,,,,
effect,"Customer mildly dissatisfied, receive bad reviews in bike ranking",2,,,
cause,Wing nut chosen instead of quick release for foldable joints,3,,,
failure_mode,Folding mechanism fatigues over time,,,,
effect,Bike requires frequent maintenance,2,,,
effect,Long term customer dissatisfied,3,,,
effect,Loss of primary functionality,4,,,
cause,New hinge selection is significantly weaker than the one used on the previouso model,1,,,
function,Bike should be able to slow down from 12m/s to 0 in less than 20m,,,,
failure_mode,Bike able to slow down in < 50m,,,,
cause,Brake pads selected for weight optimization are less efficient than disc brakes,2,,,
effect,Bad customer reputation,2,,,
