FMEA Name,Mountain Bike,,,,
FMEA Description,"X75T is due to go into production in July-2021. 
The bike is aimed at high-salary mountain bike enthusiasts.",,,,
FMEA _Type,Design,,,,
Risk Matrix ,Bike Risk Matrix (1-5),,,,
Type,Description,Rating,deadline,status,follow-up
function,Must be comfortable for the rider during extended off-road trail use,,,,
failure_mode,Handlebar to seat spacing causes pain to the riders,,,,
cause,Insufficient seat adjustment distance (currently only 10cm),3,,,
effect,"Customers unsatisfied, receive bad reviews leading to minor loss in sales",2,,,
cause,Lack of customer ergonomic data,2,,,
action,Please can you follow up on this by organising a focus group,,06/11/2020,completed,I have organised this for the 06-Oct-20
failure_mode,Insufficient dampening from large off-road obstacles,,,,
cause,No rear suspension installed on in this design.,4,,,
cause,Tyres are too narrow (currently 40mm) and don't provide enough cushioning to rider,3,,,
action,Please can you organise a review of the tyre selection choice and report back on Monday,,01/11/2020,pending,
effect,Minor discomfort is felt by the rider when cycling off-road,1,,,
function,Must be able to withstand moderate (0.5m) jumps with a 160 Kg rider,,,,
failure_mode,Seat clamp cannot provide enough friction to maintain seat height,,,,
cause,Seat clamp component is new and untested,3,,,
effect,Rider continually has to re-adjust the seat post,2,,,
failure_mode,Frame fatigues over time eventually leading to a mechanical failure,,,,
effect,Bike requires new frame after >2 years of service,4,,,
effect,"Customers unsatisfied, receive bad reviews leading to loss in sales",3,,,
cause,New material selection is known to have embrittlement risks when subjected to cyclical loading,2,,,
action,Please can you speak to the material engineer and decide if we need to conduct some lab testing,,05/11/2020,in progress,I have organised a meeting for the 29/10/2020
function,Bike should be able to accelerate from 0 to 30km/h in less than 20s with a fit rider,,,,
failure_mode,Total weight of the bike is greater than 15kg,,,,
cause,Steel frame selected instead of carbon fibre to make RRP target,3,,,
effect,Bad customer reviews and loss of potential market share,3,,,
failure_mode,Chain snaps under tension,,,,
cause,Dirt or grit gathered inside the chain and crankset,1,,,
cause,Manufacturing tolerances on new crankset slightly lower than previous model,3,,,
effect,Customer forced to replace the chain,2,,,
